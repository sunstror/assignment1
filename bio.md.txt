Hobbies: Playing Guitar, drums, juggling, knitting, magic, and programming


Programming Background:

I published a simple android game called "Apple Drop" to the Google Play store. A friend of mine from high school did the graphics
and we formed a new company called "The Town Studios".

I took a class called CS 165 last quarter and my favorite program was my final project. It was a text based game called "Color Warriors".
